## üîß Local Development Setup

This project is a single-file, client-side application and does not require a complex setup.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cyberlog-sentinel.git](https://github.com/your-username/cyberlog-sentinel.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd cyberlog-sentinel
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    * You can open the `index.html` file directly in a web browser.
    * For the best experience, it's recommended to serve the file with a simple local server. If you have Python installed:
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
